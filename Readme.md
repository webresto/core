Food E-Commerce backend core repository.

This is a hook for the [SailsJS](https://sailsjs.com/) framework, our core written in TypeScript
Here you will find basic models and methods for create you own delivery website.

For integrations with various services, we use abstract classes called [adapters](https://github.com/webresto/core/tree/staging/adapters)

> ⚠️ This repository contains only the core for the backend of the site, although it is the central part of the server; an api is also required, and even the sails project.

## Setup
We currently only support installation via docker. Look at this image [webresto/restoapp](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/webresto/restoapp/general)
