Modifiers:Sizes support:
- Now the sizes are supported at the level of modifiers, but we need to consider that the dish is a wrapper, and add different icons for the size, and can even set them globall. To do this, we can rename Dish to ITEM and add 5 types: SERVICE, DISH,  WRAPPER, PRODUCT, MODIFIER. 
- the wrapper may contain: dishes or products, or services, and sizes (sizes are different dishes or products, the service does not contain sizes)
- The dish may contain modifiers.
- The subtract cannot contain modifiers.
- modifiers are not added to the basket separately
- Unscepepers are not added to the basket not added
- Bulda and services can be intersect in the scope and modifiers
- dish, service contains modifiers setting up
